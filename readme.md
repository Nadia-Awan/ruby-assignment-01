# Assignment 01:

In today's lesson, we explored a variety of array helper methods in Ruby. Your goal for this assignment is to create a Ruby file and practice implementing these methods.

**For each helper method, create a seperate file for example:  array_size.rb (which will have an array declared and usage of array size method)**

Some of the methods we covered include:

#### **.size**
The .size method tallies the number of elements in your array and returns the count:

#### **.first**
The .first method accesses the first element of the array, the element at index 0:

#### **.last**
The .last method accesses the last element of the array:

#### **.take**
The .take method returns the first n elements of the array:

#### **.drop**
The .drop method returns the elements after n elements of the array:

#### **.pop**
The .pop method will permantently remove the last element of an array:

#### **.push**
The .push method will allow you to add an element to the end of an array:

#### **.delete**
The .delete method removes a specified element from an array permanently:

#### **.delete_at**
The .delete_at method allows you to permanently remove an element of an array at a specified index:

#### **.reverse**
The .reverse method reverses the array but does not mutate it (the original array stays as is):

#### **.select**
The .select method iterates over an array and returns a new array that includes any items that return true to the expression provided.

#### **.include?**
The include? method checks to see if the argument given is included in the array:

#### **.join**
The .join method returns a string of all the elements of the array separated by a separator parameter. If the separator parameter is nil, the method uses an empty string as a separator between strings.

#### **.each**
The .each method iterates over each element of the array, allowing you to perform actions on them.

#### **.each_with_index**

The .each_with_index method iterates over each element of the array while providing you with the location(index) of each element, allowing you to perform actions on them.

#### **.uniq**
The .uniq method takes in an array containing duplicate elements, and returns a copy of the array containing only unique elementsâ€”any duplicate elements are removed from the array.
